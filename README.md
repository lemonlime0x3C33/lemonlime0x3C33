### About Me
I'm a computer/electrical engineer who sucks at coding and can't spell, likes PCB design (the more layers the better!), robotics, all things IoT, hardware reverse engineering/VR

I don't function without espresso (a lot of it) and in my free time I like traveling, card/board/video games, reading, wine & research

Interested in AI on embedded devices (edge IoT) for security and privacy (mainly vision based at the moment, DNN, CNN type models)

I am on IRC (libera.chat) @ lemonlime0x3C33
You can reach out but there is a good chance I see your message and forget to respond, get distracted with something new, remember a week or later and feel awakward reaching out...
